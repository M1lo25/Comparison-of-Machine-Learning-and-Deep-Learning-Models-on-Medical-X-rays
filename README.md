# Comparison of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models on Medical X-rays

---

This project comparatively analyzes the performance of traditional Machine Learning models and deep neural networks for the classification of radiographic images, using the [MURA (Musculoskeletal Radiographs)](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/) dataset. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the models in detecting bone anomalies, contributing to the development of AI-assisted diagnostic systems.

## Objectives

- Compare SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, MLP, VGG-16 and DenseNet169
- Evaluate metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC
- Perform Ablation Study to understand the impact of hyperparameters and architectures
- Analyze the effect of resolution (64x64 vs 128x128)
- Position the best model within the context of the MURA leaderboard

## Models Analyzed

| Type              | Models                                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Machine Learning  | SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree  |
| Deep Learning     | Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), VGG-16, DenseNet169 |

## Dataset

- **Source**: [MURA - Stanford ML Group](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/)
- **Content**: radiographic images labeled as "normal" or "abnormal"
- **Format**: `.png` images, binary labels (`0 = normal`, `1 = abnormal`)
- **Structure**: `train`, `valid` folders and CSVs with paths and labels

## Methodology

- Preprocessing:
  - Grayscale, resizing to 64x64 / 128x128, normalization
  - Flattening (for traditional ML models)
- Training:
  - Balanced dataset, caching of preprocessed data
- Metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
